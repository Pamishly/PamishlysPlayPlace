                    <h3>Bastion</h3>
                    <p>This beefy guy can really take a hit, I've drove it perfectly fine several times before with one of the front wheels entirely ripped offed.</p>

                    <h3>Bolide</h3>
                    <p>A build of the Civetta Bolide that uses the car for what is was really made for, kicking names and taking a**, that's how it goes right?.</p>

                    <p>Honestly, this thing is all talk no show, or would it be all show no talk, I don't know but despite the looks it is really slow.</p>

                    <h3>ETK-800</h3>
                    <p>Turn off ABS and Traction Control, unlocks a great time in your free time, but in the end this should stay as a car for transporting your family to the "barbeque" that turns out to be a Wendy's</p>

                    <h3>ETK-I</h3>
                    <p>It has a paint job that stands out because it stands out, a beautiful drive in this with great brakes, great turns, however don't hit a bump or you do have a chance to flip it over.</p>

                    <h3>Marshall</h3>
                    <p>When it comes to the street, this thing will look impressive, and it is fast, until a corner appears...</p>

                    <h3>Pessima</h3>
                    <p>This is for the older Pessima and it drives pretty good if you dont need to corner too much unless you want to drive 40mph.</p>
