			<h1>PX series</h1>
            <p>The series of planes that kicks off Pamishly's kithack designs</p>

                    <h3>PX-01 Twinsies</h3>
                    <p>As the first plane to the PX-series it is by far the worst. It can't manuever and it really sucks with speed. But it's not to be judge as it is the beggining of it all</p>
              </a>
                <a class="card" href="CardPages/PX02.html">
                    <img src="../KithackPics/PxPics/PX02.jpg" alt="Picture of the Splinter">
                    <br>
                    <h3>PX-02 Splinter</h3>
                    <p>The second plane in the series but the first to start showing the traditional fighter jet style. Not the greatest with speed or maneuverability but a definite upgrade from the 01</p>
                </a>
                <a class="card" href="CardPages/PX03.html">
                    <img src="../KithackPics/PxPics/PX03.jpg" alt="Picture of the Scepter">
                    <br>
                    <h3>PX-03 Scepter</h3>
                    <p>Moving over to one engine design, the Ripper offers much better maneuverability and speed than the Splinter however, the interesting wing design makes it feel too long.</p>
                </a>
                <a class="card" href="CardPages/PX04.html">
                    <img src="../KithackPics/PxPics/PX04.jpg" alt="Picture of the Scepter">
                    <br>
                    <h3>PX-04 Ravager</h3>
                    <p>Earning the name Ravager from its high speed and maneuverability, this plane is the first of a the next generation of PX planes, however it has an issue with the batteries</p>
                </a>
                <a class="card" href="CardPages/PX05.html">
                    <img src="../KithackPics/PxPics/PX05.jpg" alt="Picture of the Ripper">
                    <br>
                    <h3>PX-05 Ripper</h3>
                    <p>While not as fast as the Raver, this plane is still registered as an upgrade due to its immense maneuverability advantage, being the first to properly pull a cobra manmaneuver.</p>
                </a>
                <a class="card" href="CardPages/PX06.html">
                    <img src="../KithackPics/PxPics/PX06.jpg" alt="Picture of the Stardrive">
                    <br>
                    <h3>PX-06 Stardrive</h3>
                    <p>Significantly faster than any previos plane in the series, while it loses some maneuverability it is fast enough and can run off one out of two engines, so it takes the place as 06.</p>
                </a>
		            <a class="card" href="CardPages/PX07.html">
                    <img src="../KithackPics/PxPics/PX07.jpg" alt="Picture of the Singularity">
                    <br>
                    <h3>PX-07 Singularity</h3>
                    <p>This thing cobras so easily, while it is slightly slower than the Stardrive it can dodge bullets so quick.</p>
                </a>
                <a class="card" href="CardPages/PX08.html">
                  <img src="../KithackPics/PxPics/PX08.jpg" alt="Picture of the Pulsar">
                  <br>
                  <h3>PX-08 Pulsar</h3>
                  <p>Not the worst plane but the 07 is better, the battery life is garbage and it doesnt manuever the greatest however it is faster.</p>
              </a>
              <a class="card" href="CardPages/PX09.html">
                <img src="../KithackPics/PxPics/PX09.jpg" alt="Picture of the Horizon">
                <br>
                <h3>PX-09 Horizon</h3>
                <p>The first plane in the series to have moving wings and not just the first to have moving landing gear, but first to have any landing gear in the first place.</p>
              </a>
              <a class="card" href="CardPages/PX10.html">
                <img src="../KithackPics/PxPics/PX10.jpg" alt="Picture of the Arrowhead">
                <br>
                <h3>PX-10 Arrowhead</h3>
                <p>It doesn't have any fancy hydraulics but its got them front swept wings and looks sick, also really fun to stand on its engines, not a hover but its still fun.</p>
              </a>
              <a class="card" href="CardPages/PX11.html">
                <img src="../KithackPics/PxPics/PX11.jpg" alt="Picture of the Cobra">
                <br>
                <h3>PX-11 Cobra</h3>
                <p>Back to the hydraulics with the retractalble landing gear, while the wings dont move on this one, it does have airbrakes that extend out the side, giving it its name the Cobra.</p>
