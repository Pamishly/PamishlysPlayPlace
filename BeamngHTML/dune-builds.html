                    <h3>Scintilla</h3>
                    <p>This abomination of a super car is great for the dunes and has an interesting look, with the engine it comes with it is an amazing driver.</p>
                </a>
                <a class="card" href="./CardPages/DuneBolide.html">

                    <h3>Bolide</h3>
                    <p>The car before the Scintilla. while it lacks AWD it still has the necessary power for the dunes. However, still an abomination of a super car.</p>
                </a>
                <a class="card" href="./CardPages/DuneAurata.html">
                    <img src="../BeamngPics/Dune/Aurata.png" alt="Picture of the Aurata">
                    <br>
                    <h3>Aurata</h3>
                    <p>A Side-by-Side that can certainly take a hit. Should still drive even after a roll or two. It can handle a better engine, however it makes it less drivable so a downgrade was necessary.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h3>Dune Kicker</h3>
                    <p>Honestly this doesn't deserve a description, worst thing on this list, contrary to the name.</p>
                </a>
                <a class="card" href="./CardPages/DuneETK800.html">

                    <br>
                    <h3>ETK-800</h3>
                    <p>While better than the Dune Kicker, the wheel size difference on this thing even confuses me and I made it. Performs good enough to be shared though so I'll take it.</p>
                </a>
                <a class="card" href="./CardPages/DuneHSeries.html">

                    <br>
                    <h3>H-Series</h3>
                    <p>This was made as a joke but works surprisingly well that I had to keep it. Also if you install the Company Cruiser livery mod, this thing uses that.</p>

                    <h3>Old Pessima</h3>
                    <p>This is for the older Pessima model, this thing performs as well as it looks, as in its up for opinion I honestly can't tell you how well it works.</p>
                </a>
                <a class="card" href="./CardPages/DunePiccolina.html">

                    <h3>Piccolina</h3>
                    <p>This is my favorite one and I don't even like how it looks, enough said.</p>

                    <h3>Roamer</h3>
                    <p>I would love to do this to my Dad's Suburban, this thing works wonderfully and it is so much fun to drive, oh and it can really take a beating without flinching.</p>
