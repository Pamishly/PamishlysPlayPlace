			<h1>PX series</h1>
            <p>The series of planes that kicks off Pamishly's kithack designs</p>

                    <h3>PX-01 Twinsies</h3>
                    <p>As the first plane to the PX-series it is by far the worst. It can't manuever and it really sucks with speed. But it's not to be judge as it is the beggining of it all</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">

                    <br>
                    <h3>PX-02 Splinter</h3>
                    <p>The second plane in the series but the first to start showing the traditional fighter jet style. Not the greatest with speed or maneuverability but a significant upgrade from the 01</p>
                </div>

                    <br>
                    <h3>PX-03 Scepter</h3>
                    <p>Moving over to one engine design, the Ripper offers much better maneuverability and speed than the Splinter however, the interesting wing design makes it feel too long.</p>

                    <h3>PX-04 Ravager</h3>
                    <p>Earning the name Ravager from its high speed and maneuverability, this plane is the first of a the next generation of PX planes, however it has an issue with the batteries</p>

                <div class="card">

                    <br>
                    <h3>PX-05 Ripper</h3>
                    <p>While not as fast as the Raver, this plane is still registered as an upgrade due to its immense maneuverability advantage, being the first to properly pull a cobra manmaneuver.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <img src="./PxPics/PX06.png" alt="Picture of the Stardrive">
                    <br>
                    <h3>PX-06 Stardrive</h3>
                    <p>Significantly faster than any previos plane in the series, while it loses some maneuverability it is fast enough and can run off one out of two engines it takes the place as 06.</p>
